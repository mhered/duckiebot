# Duckiebot
Two years after completing the [Self-Driving Cars with Duckietown MOOC on edx](https://www.edx.org/learn/technology/eth-zurich-self-driving-cars-with-duckietown) I decided to dust off my Duckiebot and play with it to apply some of the things I learned in the last couple of years.

This repo contains the notes I collected while playing with my Duckiebot. 

## Power up
The first challenge was charging the battery after two years unused and powering up the bot.

- I plugged the bot and tried to power it up (Note: using the side button in the battery, ot the button at the top which is only to power down) and the robot wouldn't boot. The LEDs lit up in odd colours but the screen didn't work. After a while I noticed the fan in the Jetson would start to power up briefly and then power down again.
- I came to the conclusion that the battery was totally drained and followed the advice in [the docs FAQ](https://docs.duckietown.com/daffy/opmanual-duckiebot/debugging_and_troubleshooting/faq/index.html) and in [Slack](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/duckietown/a/230/1434) to unplug the HUT cables going to motors and Jetson letting only the cables needed to charge the battery for 5+ hours.
